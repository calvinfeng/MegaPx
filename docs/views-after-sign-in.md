## User Homepage
Since this is a MVP, it has very limited functionality. The primary functions
are photo management and location-based photo discovery.

![user-home-page]

## Dropdown menu
Users can navigate to their profile, their photo management, settings and
log out through the dropdown menu. Discovery feed changes its content as user
moves and drags their location on the minimap.
